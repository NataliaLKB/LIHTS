				<p>There is a notion that everyone should be a leader all the time and, if leadership is so game-changing, we must need more of it from everyone, all the time. In fact, research shows that it takes both roles – leadership AND followership – to get the best results. They are equally valuable. Leadership is one half of a partnership.</p>
